# Project Title

Week 5 Assignment: Weather API

## Description
The purpose of this READme is to provide a detailed description of my weather website.

The site is used to search weather for any city in the world.

One a city has been entered and searched, the current forecast for the day is displayed. As well as a 5 day forecast for that same city below.

The most recently searched city is then saved below under 'previous searches' to allow the user to conveniently search the weather for that city again.

The weather is generated from an API from the Open Weather Map website.

The URL for this API is as follows:
https://openweathermap.org/api

The site can be accessed via this link:
https://tjsoho.github.io/weather-api/


### This repository contains:
* A READme file detailing the assignment and the site
* Html.index file
* Assets folder that contains the following:
* Png file of the site
* Images folder containing the images used in the site
* Css folder containing css style sheet
* Javascript folder containing the javascript file

This site was built from scratch. No code was provided to begin.

I started by using a wire frame to design the site followed by laying out the sections in HTML. I build this site from Desktop down which seemed fairly easy to operate with as there were not many elements to style.



Below is a screenshot of what the site looks like now.
